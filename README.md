This is Andrew Yoon and Kevin Bundschuh's CS213 Photo Album Project.

### How do I get set up? ###

To our grader...

I have created a user profile called 'anwar' beforehand. It should have 2 albums.
One album is named 'Korea' and contains 10 photos of mine.
The other is 'nature' and contains 6 photos from google. I realized I downloaded them very small so when they are enlarged they come out as blurry.

### Google Vision Api ###

Also, Google Vision API, is available on our project. You can use this feature when adding photos or modifying them. It sends the http request and recieves the tags. It asks for your approval and inserts the tags.

### Peculiarities and Bugs ###

I chose to serialize and save after each important change, such as adding photos and creating albums. Because of this, the gui may lag a few seconds. Please be aware of that. Thank you for your patience.
